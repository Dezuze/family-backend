## 🌳 Family Tree

The flagship feature — a fully interactive, pan/zoom/searchable genealogy visualisation.

### Visual Design
- **Gender-Coded Cards**: Soft blue tint for males, soft rose for females, gold highlight for logged-in user.
- **Accent Bars & Avatar Rings**: Gradient top bar and coloured rings matching gender palette.
- **Warm Background**: Subtle gradient with decorative cross-pattern overlay.

### Tree Rendering (D3.js)
- **Forest Layout**: Supports multiple disconnected family trees rendered side-by-side.
- **Dynamic Separation**: Spouse-aware spacing algorithm prevents card overlap:
  - Both siblings married → 2.5× base spacing (500px)
  - One sibling married → 2.2× (440px)
  - Unmarried siblings → 1.5× (300px)
- **Dynamic Tree Width**: Each tree's bounds are calculated and offset dynamically (no fixed spacing).
- **Spouse Rendering**: Spouses render as adjacent cards with dashed connector lines.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Spouse-of-tree-node detection prevents the same member from appearing in multiple trees.

### Relationship Chaining (Backend)
All relationship types are converted to hierarchical `parent` / `spouse` links:

| User Says            | Tree Link Created                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Father / Mother      | `parent` → direct parent link                           |
| Son / Daughter       | `parent` → user becomes parent of target                |
| Grandparent variants | `parent` → chains through Father/Mother as intermediary |
| Brother / Sister     | `parent` → both become children of shared parent        |
| Uncle / Aunt         | `parent` → becomes child of grandparent                 |
| Cousin               | `parent` → becomes child of uncle/aunt                  |
| Father/Mother-in-law | `parent` → becomes parent of user's spouse              |
| Sister/Brother-in-law| `spouse` → linked to the appropriate sibling            |
| Nephew / Niece       | `parent` → becomes child of user's sibling              |

### Interactive Features
- **Auto-Focus**: Tree smoothly pans and zooms to the logged-in user's card on page load.
- **Search & Focus**: Type a name → dropdown shows matches → click to smoothly pan/zoom to that card.
- **Member Detail Modal**: Click any card to view full profile details.
- **DOB or Age Toggle**: Members can be added with either Date of Birth or direct Age input.
- **"Married To?" Picker**: When adding in-laws, a dropdown lets you specify which sibling they're married to.

## Ownership And Permissions

### Member Lifecycle
- **Managed member**: Created by a guardian, defaults to non-independent.
- **Independent member**: Can be set independent and no longer managed by guardian flows.
- **Account owner**: A member linked to a user account can self-manage profile-related updates.

### Edit Rules
- Account owners can manage themselves.
- Guardians can manage members they created when those members are not independent and do not already have their own account.
- Tree editing and sensitive actions use these same ownership checks.

## Link Existing Members In Tree

Tree Editor supports two add-relative modes:
- **Create New**: Creates a new member and links them.
- **Link Existing**: Searches current tree-visible members by name and links an existing profile.

### Relation Constraints
- **Spouse**: Maximum one spouse per member.
- **Parents**: Maximum one father, one mother, and two total parents.
- **Self-link prevention**: A member cannot be linked to themselves.
- **Duplicate relation prevention**: Existing relation edges are rejected.

### Families API Endpoints

- `POST /api/families/tree-edit/{id}/add-relative/`

## 🗺️ Data Relationships

The backend uses a **Smart Sync** architecture:
- **Family**: Core unit for all members.
- **FamilyMember**: Linked 1-to-1 with a **User** account via signals.
- **Relationship**: Directed edge (`from_member → to_member`) with a named type. The tree-builder converts these into hierarchical parent/spouse links.
- **FamilyHead**: Automatically identifies and tracks the head of each family branch.

## 📱 Deployment & Production

- **Docker Ready**: Includes `infra/production/docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment and `infra/management/docker-compose.yml` for Portainer.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment.
- **Traefik Integration**: Automatic SSL/TLS certificate management.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration via .env files.
- **Static Assets**: Optimized for CDN delivery.
